This project is a practical example accompanying a blog post from [timoner.com](https://timoner.com), a technical blog dedicated to modern web development and programming best practices.

## Context

This application serves as a concrete example for the article ["Next.js 15: TypeScript Forms with Prisma and Clean Architecture"](https://timoner.com/en/nextjs/nextjs-form-zod-hexagonal-architecture). It demonstrates how to create a professional form system with:

- Next.js 15
- Type-safe validation with Zod
- Modern components with shadcn/ui
- Data persistence with Prisma
- Hexagonal architecture

To make learning more fun, the example is built around a Jedi Academy registration system! 🚀

## Learning Objectives

This application demonstrates:
- How to structure a modern web application
- Implementation of hexagonal architecture
- Robust form validation

## Installation and Setup

```bash
npm install
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```
